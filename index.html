        <p>Hey! Welcome to my website! This is a super simple website based off of work by github user <code>cadars</code>.</p>

        <p>
          I hope to fill out the website slowly over the next few weeks and months with random thoughts and musings, as well as photos and videos.
          I don't have any particular idea yet of what the content will be but we'll find out together.
        </p>

      <section id="about"> <!-- ABOUT -->

        <p> hello hello!</p>

        <p> I am the Product Lead at REACT Neuro, a healthtech startup focused on quantifying brain health. I lead the product design and planning process and I work closely
            with the VR, mobile, backend, DevOps, data science and clinical teams to create a seamless experience and deliver actionable insights for healthcare providers and patients.

            I initially started on the data science team and helped build out most of the backend infrastructure that processes our high-fidelity timeseries data. Although I don't write
            as much code anymore nowadays, you can still find me debugging error logs and optimizing our data engineering pipelines whenever I have some time! </p>

        <p> Before REACT, I worked in a cancer biomechanics lab at Berkeley, then a microfluidics lab at UCSF, and then a cancer microfluidics lab at Harvard (really
            bringing it all together). Through these labs I had the chance to work on a smattering of computational methods for segmentation of cell images, and then finally
            worked on computational analysis of multispectral images taken of head and neck cancer tumors in varying stages of disease progression, as defined by pEMT. </p>

        <p> I also worked for some time at Instagram through consulting, where I focused on designing features that would make the app more sticky for college-age users. And having
            caught the product bug from this, I collaborated with a physician at UCSF to help prototype a tablet app that would help streamline communication in ER between physicians
            and the family members of patients.</p>

        <p> More recently, I've been particularly engaged by problems in urban design and in environmental engineering. I think there are countless opportunities to make a
            difference in climate-related issues and technologies and I hope to explore some of those topics in various small posts here.</p>

        <p> Outside of work and academic interests, I am an avid photographer and dancer. I've been making photos for almost 10 years now and my work has run the gamut
            from portraits to landscapes, and many things in between. Nowadays (and perhaps always, though I didn't know it at the time) I find the most joy in documenting
            the quiet moments between the hubbub of ordinary life.</p>

        <p> I've also been dancing some form of hip-hop-inspired dance for the last 7 years and have recently become much more interested in house dancing. You can
            catch me taking dance classes in NYC fairly regularly, and I'm always down to move to music! I'll be sharing some of the music that has recently caught my ear,
            as well as music from throughout my life.</p>

        <p> Truthfully, this website is just meant to help me have a central place to put my thoughts, nothing more. Hopefully others will also find some of the topics
            interesting, but even if not, that's fine by me. Hope everyone is doing well and staying happy and healthy!</p>
