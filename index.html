        <p>Hey! Welcome to my website! This is a super simple website based off of work by cadars.</p>

        <p>
          I hope to fill out the website slowly over the next few weeks and months with random thoughts and musings, as well as photos and videos.
          I don't have any particular idea yet of what the content will be but we'll find out together.
        </p>

        <p>hello hello!</p>

        <p> My name is Suhaas and I'm currently living in NYC. Recently, I've been particularly engaged by problems in urban design and in environmental engineering.
            I think there are countless opportunities to make a difference in climate-related issues and technologies and I hope to explore some of those topics in
            the various small posts here.
        </p>

        <p> Outside of work and academic interests, I am an avid photographer and dancer. I've been making photos for almost 10 years now and my work has run the gamut
            from portraits to landscapes, and many things in between. Nowadays (and perhaps always, though I didn't know it at the time)I find the most joy in documenting
            the quiet moments between the hubbub of ordinary life.
        </p>

        <p> I've also been dancing some form of hip-hop-inspired dance for the last 7 years and have recently become much more interested in house dancing. You can
            catch me taking dance classes in NYC fairly regularly, and I'm always down to move to music! I'll be sharing some of the music that has recently caught my ear,
            as well as music from throughout my life.
        </p>

        <p> Truthfully, this website is just meant to help me have a central place to put my thoughts, nothing more. Hopefully others will also find some of the topics
            interesting, but even if not, that's fine by me. Hope everyone is doing well and staying happy and healthy!
        </p>
