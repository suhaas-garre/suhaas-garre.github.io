            <p class="home_body">I am currently a Master's student in the <a target="_newtab" href="https://cee.stanford.edu">Environmental Engineering</a> program at <a target="_newtab" href="https://stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>. I completed my undergraduate at the <a target="_newtab" href="https://www.berkeley.edu">University of California, Berkeley</a> with a degree in <a target="_newtab" href="https://bioeng.berkeley.edu">Bioengineering</a>.</p>

            <p class="home_body">My professional interests center around addressing the scalability challenges of the renewable energy sector, exploring new applications of machine learning to societal issues, and generally how to optimally deploy technological solutions to build resiliency at scale.</p>

            <p class="home_body">I've most recently consulted with CrossnoKaye, Gravity Climate, and charity: water in matters of both product development and data science. This work has spanned industrial energy optimization, carbon accounting, and water supply resiliency, respectively. </p>

            <p class="home_body">Before climate-tech, I worked extensively in the biotech space, first at the Abate Lab at UCSF, and then at the Stott Lab at Harvard Medical School. All of that work was in some way related to applying medical devices to collect and analyze biological data at very high throughputs. I then spent some time in the startup world working as a data scientist and product lead at REACT Neuro. For a more thorough timeline, here is my LinkedIn.</p>

            <p class="home_body">Outside of professional pursuits, I enjoy digital and film photography, reading lighthearted books (especially the works of PG Wodehouse), and attempting random Fermi estimations.</p>
