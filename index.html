        <h2> now </h2>
        <p> I am the Product Lead at REACT Neuro, a healthtech startup focused on quantifying brain health. I lead the product design and planning process and I work closely
            with the VR, mobile, backend, DevOps, data science and clinical teams to create a seamless experience and deliver actionable insights for healthcare providers and patients.
            I initially started on the data science team and helped build out most of the backend infrastructure that processes our high-fidelity timeseries data. Although I don't write
            as much code anymore nowadays, you can still find me debugging error logs and optimizing our data engineering pipelines whenever I have some time! </p>

        <h2> bio </h2>

        <h2> later </h2>
        <p> More recently, I've been particularly engaged by problems in urban design and in environmental engineering. I hope to explore some of those topics in
          various small posts here as I learn more about them.</p>

        <h2> other </h2>
        <p> Outside of work and academic interests, I am an avid photographer. Nowadays (and perhaps always, though I didn't know it at the time) I find the most joy in documenting
            the quiet moments between the hubbub of ordinary life. </p>

        <p> I've also been dancing some form of hip-hop-inspired dance for the last 7 years and have recently become much more interested in house dancing. You can
            catch me taking dance classes in NYC fairly regularly, and I'm always down to move to music!</p>

        <p> Truthfully, this website is just meant to help me have a central place to put my thoughts, nothing more. Hopefully others will also find some of the topics
            interesting, but even if not, that's fine by me. Hope everyone is doing well and staying happy and healthy!</p>
