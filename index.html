            <p class="home_body">I am currently a Master's student in the <a target="_newtab" href="https://cee.stanford.edu">Environmental Engineering</a> program at <a target="_newtab" href="https://stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>. I completed my undergraduate at the <a target="_newtab" href="https://www.berkeley.edu">University of California, Berkeley</a> with a degree in <a target="_newtab" href="https://bioeng.berkeley.edu">Bioengineering</a>.</p>

            <p class="home_body">My professional interests generally center around how to optimally deploy technological solutions at scale. I thrive under ambiguity and I enjoy applying my ability to engage with both technical and non-technical stakeholders in various disciplines. My explorations currently span energy-tech, fintech, and biotech. My main goal is to surround myself with bright people working on hard problems. That's where all the fun is!</p>

            <p class="home_body">I've most recently consulted with <a target="_newtab" href="https://crossnokaye.com">CrossnoKaye</a>, <a target="_newtab" href="https://www.gravityclimate.com">Gravity Climate</a>, and <a target="_newtab" href="https://www.charitywater.org">charity: water</a> in matters of both product development and data science. This work has spanned industrial energy optimization, carbon accounting, and water supply resiliency, respectively. </p>

            <p class="home_body">Before climate-tech, I worked extensively in the biotech space, first at the <a target="_newtab" href="https://www.abatelab.org">Abate Lab</a> at UCSF, and then at the <a target="_newtab" href="https://stottlab.massgeneral.org">Stott Lab</a> at Harvard Medical School. All of that work was in some way related to applying medical devices to collect and analyze biological data at very high throughputs. I then spent some time in the startup world working as a data scientist and product lead at <a target="_newtab" href="https://reactneuro.com">REACT Neuro</a>. For a more thorough timeline, here is my <a target="_newtab" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/suhaasgarre/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

            <p class="home_body">Outside of professional pursuits, I enjoy digital and film photography, reading lighthearted books (especially the works of <a target="_newtab" href="https://www.wodehouse.co.uk/">PG Wodehouse</a>), and attempting random Fermi estimations.</p>
