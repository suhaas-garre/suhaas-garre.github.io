              While I was growing up, my family always had homecooked meals made by my mom. We'd eat out maybe once per week at most, and even that
              might have been something as basic as pizza from Papa John's, just to get the CD that they used to include during holiday times. It wasn't due to the cost so much
              as the value that my family ascribed to fresh, healthy, traditional meals.
            </p>

              It would take my mom over an hour to make dinner, but every dinner would include rice,
              some sort of lentil stew (some of you may know this as <i>dal</i>), a vegetable stir fry, and a soup (<i>rasam</i> or <i>sambar</i>). There's no denying that it was
              hard work but it was always nourishing food prepared with love and care.

              For nearly the last decade of my life, since leaving home for college, my diet has taken an undeniable turn for the worse. I eat out for many meals every week,
              even as I acknowledge the benefits of cooking at home.
            </p>

            <p>
              Of course, this is a function of time and skill. I don't have the time to spend 2 hours per day making food, and I don't have the skill to make food much faster than that.
              Throw in the unfortunate (or fortunate?) character trait of being fairly picky with the quality of food that I choose to consume and you end up with me eating out
              fairly often (much to my wallet's chagrin).
            </p>

            <p>
              I am fortunate to both be in a financial position where this is not crippling, as well as to have been in great food cities.

              Berkeley, where I completed my undergrad, had no lack of great food (primarily Asian) and also had many relatively cheap options.

              New York City, where I currently reside, has a huge variety of food pretty much any street you turn down. Unfortunately, food here is certainly NOT cheap, though
              of course you can still find cheap eats if that's your goal.

              I really began to appreciate the importance of being able to make good food when I lived in Boston. It is difficult to overstate how disappointing the food in Boston
              is. I could spend many paragraphs pondering how a city with so many diverse students and residents could possibly be largely devoid of good food (<i>Our Zone</i> in Allston
              is a shining exception) but that would be unnecessary. Suffice to say, Boston is not a food capital in this beautiful Nationâ„¢.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my time in Boston, I began to cook at home way more often. I was also making a paltry income as a research tech at Harvard Medical School (perhaps the topic
              of another post) so if I wanted to have any savings at all, I couldn't eat out for every single meal.
