              <p>Here are two songs with no relation to one another but ones that I used to listen to while growing up. </p>
              <p>Dana Hocking used to create music for card magic/flourishing videos, which I used to watch obsessively as a teenager. </p>

              <p> 
                Nazia Hassan was one of the very first pop stars to come out of Pakistan and her music was very famous in both Pakistan and in India. I used to listen to this song a lot when growing up, but this particular remix took me over 10 years to find.

          <br>

            <p>
              When I was in middle school, I used to follow a music blog called <i>musigh</i>, which was updated by an anonymous poster who went by the name of Beni. Beni compiled songs that people either sent him or that he found while perusing the internet. Sadly, <i>musigh's</i> anonymous owner mysteriously and abruptly stopped posting in 2014 and never returned. The selections and songs on that blog had a deep influence on my music taste, and I still go back and listen to many of the songs that I downloaded from the site back in the day.
            </p>

            <p>
              One thing that Beni used to do that I'd like to revive is something he called "Sunday Chillin'." Every Sunday, he would post links to 3-4 songs along with a random photo that he found and liked. I hope he doesn't mind, but I'd like to copy this format, and will post my own version of Sunday Chillin' below. Unlike Beni's version, I won't necessarily only be posting new songs I find every week to start with, but perhaps one day that'll be where I land too. The first one will be posted this Sunday (07.24.2022). 
            </p>

            <p>
              I hope you enjoy your Sundays as you listen through these weekly picks and I hope these songs do for you what <i>musigh</i> did for me. 
            </p>
