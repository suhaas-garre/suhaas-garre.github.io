# childhood friends and humor

Coming back to my hometown during the holiday season has always felt like a sort of reset period for me. As soon as the plane touches down on the runway, I feel myself relaxing in a way that I haven't yet found anywhere else. Some part of this is of course due to the fact that my family is sure to be waiting at home for me with unconditional love and care (and great food!). But I think a huge aspect of the comfort I associate with home can be attributed to the high school friends that also return at the same time.

High school friends differ from college friends in their expectations of you. These people have seen you at your absolute lowest (thinking about how awkward I was in middle school and high school still hurts me) and there's no amount of pretending that can convince them that you are cooler than you are. Whereas friends made in adulthood may have caught you in more compromising situations (alcohol-induced perhaps), this pales in comparison to the incriminating moments that your childhood friends have witnessed. Remember that extremely embarrassing thing you did in 9th grade while talking to a girl? No? Well, your friends do. And they'll make sure you do too.
