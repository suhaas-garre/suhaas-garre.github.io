opinions i currently hold with varying amounts of evidence 01.09.2022

lawns suck
solar power seems very promising
  building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and building-adapted photovoltaics (BAPV)
crypto seems like a scam
NFTs are dumb lol
oracle tech seems cool from a technical perspective
microplastics should concern us more
the ramifications of plastic use are not yet fully understood (probably also bad when cold)
revolutions in farming are probably necessary (what is the state of current global farming?)
  vertical farming + vertical solar farms?
the global refugee problem due to climate change will overwhelm current systems/societies
we're probably not too far from wars waged over water (if they haven't already begun)
overfishing is about to really tank global food systems shortly

chemicals generally used for "convenience" (e.g. nonstick) will ultimately come back to bite us hard
good diet and sleep are basically all you need for health
car-based societies suck, public transportation is basically always better from a macro perspective
the automotive and petroleum industries crippled the public transportation sector to bolster their profits at the expense of everyone else
humans were not really meant to eat meat and we should lessen our dependence on it
