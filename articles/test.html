            I am the Product Lead at REACT Neuro, a healthtech startup focused on quantifying brain health. I lead the product design and planning process and I work closely
            with the VR, mobile, backend, DevOps, data science and clinical teams to create a seamless experience and deliver actionable insights for healthcare providers and patients.
            I initially started on the data science team and helped build out most of the backend infrastructure that processes our high-fidelity timeseries data. Although I don't write
            as much code anymore nowadays, you can still find me debugging error logs and optimizing our data engineering pipelines whenever I have some time!
